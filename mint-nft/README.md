1. Project Setup
Set up a new project using your preferred web development stack (Next.js - npx create-next-app app-name).

2. UI Design
Implement the UI for the minting page based on the Figma design. Include inputs for title, description, and image upload.

3. Wallet Connection
Integrate a wallet connection library (e.g., Rainbow kit) to allow users to connect their wallets to the application.

5. Image Upload to IPFS
Implement a function to upload the image to IPFS. You can use a library like ipfs-http-client for this.

const ipfsClient = require('ipfs-http-client');
const ipfs = ipfsClient({ host: 'ipfs.infura.io', port: 5001, protocol: 'https' });

async function uploadToIPFS(file) {
  const result = await ipfs.add(file);
  const ipfsHash = result.path;
  return ipfsHash;
}
5. Create JSON Object
Based on the OpenSea Metadata Standards, create a standardized JSON object containing the title, description, and the IPFS URI of the uploaded image.

const metadata = {
  name: title,
  description: description,
  image: `ipfs://${ipfsHash}`,
};
6. Store JSON Object to IPFS
Similar to the image upload, store the JSON object to IPFS.

7. Minting Function
Implement a service call to the contract using the Web3 library. Ensure that the user is connected to their wallet before calling the minting function.
const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(contractAbi, contractAddress);

async function mintNFT() {
  const to = userWalletAddress; // Get user's wallet address
  const uri = `ipfs://${jsonObjectIPFSHash}`;

  await contract.methods.mint(to, uri).send({ from: userWalletAddress })
    .on('transactionHash', (hash) => {
      // Transaction successful, notify the user
      console.log('Transaction Hash:', hash);
      // Show success message on the UI
    })
    .on('error', (error) => {
      // Error occurred, notify the user
      console.error('Error:', error);
      // Show error message on the UI
    });

8. Testing
Thoroughly test the minting process, wallet connection, image upload, and contract interaction to ensure a seamless user experience.

9. Deployment
Deploy your application and IPFS server. Ensure that the contract is deployed on the appropriate blockchain.

10. Run application
npm install
npm run dev   

Additional Notes
Secure sensitive information, such as API keys and contract addresses.
Consider adding error handling and loading indicators to enhance the user experience.
Regularly update dependencies and follow best practices for code organization and security.
This is a high-level overview, and you may need to adjust the steps based on your specific requirements and chosen technologies.
